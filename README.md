# cfunitdrafts
Raw text for wikitext cos they dont have a draft feature........


# What's this all about?
Here in this repo, we put drafts up for Crash Fever units that will (hopefully) be added to the wikia.
Since the wikia does not offer the option to create drafts, and I don't like editing things more than I have to...I upload the files here since the format is the closet to Wikitext.


# What's gonna happen to the files...and is githib really the place to do this?
After I upload the units onto the wikia, ill probably try to delete them to make things neater...if I can LOL I dont rememeber deleting files b4 :hmmmface:
Also why github? Text friendly ma dudes, and plus its nice to be able to save files onto a repo instead of having them saved everywhere and anywhere :3


# Well I'm here anyway, what's up with writing these anyways?
So basically CF is a mobile game that lacks information on their wikia...s – They have a few.
Since I have access to this information (and not many ppl add to it), why not add some myself ya know.
